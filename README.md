## ccPCA: contrasting clusters in PCA - C++ Library and Python Module

New
-----
* Python implementation of cPCA, ccPCA is completely changed to only use python for easiler implementation (2025-04-23).
    - Compared with previous C++ binded version, this version has much faster when data size is large (but slightly slower for small data). Also, Python version supports any float precisions.
* Supported installation using virtual environments (due to the use of venv became a default from Python3.12) (2024-04-14).
* Now, all Mac OS, Linux, Windows are supported (2022-04-27).

* Demonstration of a system using ccPCA: http://kwonoh.net/ccpca/

* Features
  * Fast C++ and Python implementations of Contrastive PCA (cPCA) from [Abid and Zhang et al., 2018].<br />

  * Also, full automatic selection of contrastive parameter alpha from [Fujiwara et al., 2022].

  * An extended version of cPCA (ccPCA) for contrasting clusters.

  * Algorithms for generating an effective, scalable feature contribution visualization, including optimal sign flipping of (c)PCA, matrix reordering, and aggregation.

* Use case examples
  * Analysis of dimensionality reduction results (compare some points with others)
  * Analysis of clustering results (compare some cluster with others)
  * Analysis of labeled data (compare some label with others)

******

Requirements
-----
* All major OSs are supported (macOS, Linux, Windows)

* Python3 (latest)

* Note: Tested on macOS Sequoia. Planning to test wih Ubuntu and Windows.

******

Setup (Python implementation)
-----

* Install the modules with pip3 (this installs numpy and scipy if it does not exist).

    `pip3 install .`

* You can test with sample.py

    `pip3 install matplotlib scikit-learn`

    `python3 sample.py`

******

Usage
-----
* With Python3
    * Import installed modules from python, for example: 
        - `from cpca import CPCA`
        - `from ccpca import CCPCA`
        - `from fc_view import OptSignFlip, MatReorder`
    * See ccpca/sample.py and sample.ipynb for examples.
    * Also, there are detailed documentations in cpca/cpca.py, ccpca/ccpca.py, fc_view/mat_reorder.py, and fc_view/opt_sign_flip.py

* With C++
    * Include header files (e.g., ccpca.hpp) in C++ code with cpp files (e.g., ccpca.cpp).
